The source code can be found in Optimization.py. The input data can be found in heart.csv.
To run the model both the source code and the data file have to be in the same folder.
There are two functions in the model:
1) optimizationFunction -  this function runs the four optimization algorithms for the three optimization problems (Knap Sack, Four Peaks and Max-K Colors).
	The parameters of this function are as follows: input data set size, starting value for the number of iterations, maximum value for number of iterations, step size for the number of iterations, 	starting value for the number of attempts, maximum value for number of attempts, step size for 	number of attempts
2) nnModelFunction - this function is for the second part of the project. To find the optimal weights for the Neural Network and evaluate the model based on accuracies.

The parameters of this function are as follows: starting value for the number of iterations, maximum value for number of iterations, step size for the number of iterations,starting value for the number of attempts, maximum value for number of attempts, step size for number of attempts, starting value for training data set size as a proportion, maximum value for the training data set size as a proportion, step size for the training data set size as a proportion
